Points to be write in document

---> It automatically check the location permission as well.

// web hooks
// api that gives all ats ids according provided radius and ats_ids



(1) Enable or disable log
(2) Location fetch Interval
(3) enable disable developer mode
(4) Setting pending intent for clicking over notification
(5) it is important to give permission and add dependencies in main app as well other library will not fetch location by itself
(6) get ATS id that will fetch just after device gets connected from server
(7) Explanation about log stash sync rate that sync data from DB according to this rate
(8) For adding a listening key (ie ats_id) to listen other target device, developer can also add other key as well rather than ats_id and can send event via test API
(9) Removing a particular listener
(10) Remove all listeners will remove all listeners from server first (one by one) the remove listeners from local preferences.
(11) add , remove and get tag
(12) listen to tag and explain logic behind this tag listener.
(13) stop listening tag will not take any input cause at a time user can list only one tag , but can listen more than one listener.
(14) start and end trip concept explanation
--> force location update feature that is before ending trip it is important to push all remaining location that is being cashed locally in library itself


// Pending test use case
// (1) if there are lots of location stack exist in library and certainly if developers ends the trip then there could be condition generated polyline will be incorrect.


// documentation improvement
 (1) create full application class so that developer will not add initial code in any activity.


// Backend improvement
 (1) remove tag from the listeners table when it got disconnected from socket server and add it again when it get connected
 (2) Tags of two different application can be same (ie created by to different developer) add package name as well ----> (RESOLVED VIA ADDING DEVELOPER ID )
